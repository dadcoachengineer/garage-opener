Garage door project to convert my Liftmaster MyQ opener to local only operation. They have had a few outages over the past year and I also think it is quite silly to send some things to/from cloud services.

ESP32 + Relay + Opener PCB + Ultrasonic Sensor

Everything mounted tidy in a project box. Ultrasonic tx/rx poking through the lid.
